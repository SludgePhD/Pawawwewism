- `reader` is too hard to use, even a single blocking I/O operation on anything other than the `Shutdown` implementor breaks it
  - given that the point of `reader` is to *allow* (cancelable) I/O, this occurs too often to be practical
  -> remove it?
- move `background`/`Worker` etc. into a `thread` module
- add a hybrid channel similar to flume (except without the dependencies)

isochronous processor might be better as a `Stream` extension (`stream.pace()`?)
a better name relating to "wall clock time" might also be better
